		p.front-textbox I'm a software developer and writer from New York City. Here are some of the things people tell me I'm good at.

					| <a class="hoverlink" href="/projects/advanced-webmobile-development">Advanced full stack web development</a> for clients such as <a href="">PowerBar</a> (Drupal), <a href="">Center for Disease Control</a> (Drupal, Solr) and <a href="">Wellformative</a> (Drupal, Drupal Commerce). I'm currently obsessed with Node.js, Angular.js and the MEAN stack, which I believe points the way to the future of web development. I've been watching the field evolve for a long time: my major past projects include <a href="">Words Without Borders</a> and (going way back) <a href="">Time Warner's Pathfinder</a>, where I learned my craft.

					| I specialize in <a href="projects/content-management-and-search">Content Management Systems and Custom Search Engine Development</a> are two of my specialties. I developed a custom back-end for Market Research Corporation's private repository of PDF documents, worked on a massively scaleable Autonomy-based legal search engine for <a href="">Inference Data</a> and also used Autonomy to power a new search engine for <a href="">History Channel</a>. I am currently very excited about the possibilities of MongoDB and Keystone CMS, a Node-based CMS platform which you can see in action right here on MarcEliotStein.com.

					| I love to see projects I work on succeed, and have often delved deep into <a href="/projects/social-media-strategy">Social Media Strategy</a> to help my clients. I launched <a href="">Foreign Policy</a>  magazine's Twitter presence, and helped the Department of Labor-funded project <a href="">Virtual Career Network</a> come up with a UX strategy that attracts audiences. I did early work in this area for <a href="">iVillage</a>, where I collaborated with the community team on a member profile redesign that brought in millions of pageviews a month and demonstrated the considerable power of organic social marketing.

					| Let's be honest: clients and companies hire me for my tech skills. But I also have a good eye for <a href="">Art Design</a>, and am proudest of projects on which I've had complete ownership of the visual experience and got to play with Photoshop as well as Linux. I favor Bootstrap for responsive design, enjoy working with advanced LESS and CSS, and always try to stay on top of the ever-changing field of UX. You can get an idea of my web design aesthetic by checking out <a href="">The Law Firm of Laurence P. Greenberg</a>, <a href="">Practical Handbook of Group Counseling</a> and <a href="">Eli Stein Cartoons</a>.

					| And what are we doing all this hard work for, if not to create a better world? I am deeply committed to causes like pacifism, environmental awareness and social justice, and have recently kicked off a crowdfunded project called <a href="">Pacifism for the 21st Century</a>, a work in progress.

					| Last but not least: what I'm really all about is <a href="/projects/arts-music-and-literature">Music, Literature & Art</a>. I was the sole coder for <a href="">Bob Dylan's</a> first website back in 1996, and relaunched his website in 2001. I also built an innovative official website for <a href="">Pearl Jam</a> in 2006. The most enduring project of my life (other than parenthood) has been my own literary blog, <a href="">Literary Kicks</a>, which has been online (and morphing and changing with the times) since the summer of 1994.

		p.front-textbox Thanks for checking out the work I've done. If you'd like to work with me, please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>. By the way, the banner image at the top of the page is a rebus. If you're not sure what that means, or need a clue to figure it out, send me a note and I'll happily explain.
